;; fastnav.el -- Fast navigation and editing routines.

;; Version 1.04

;; Copyright (C) 2008, 2009, 2010  Zsolt Terek <zsolt@google.com>
;;
;; Compatibility: GNU Emacs 22, 23.
;;
;; Inspired by zap-to-char, this library defines different routines operating on
;; the next/previous N'th occurrence of a character.  When invoking one of these
;; commands, the user is interactively queried for a character while the
;; potential target positions are highlighted.
;;
;; For example, META-s (jump-to-char-forward) highlights the next occurrences of
;; each character and prompts for one.  Once the user picks a char, the point is
;; moved to that position.  Subsequent invocations of META-s before picking a
;; character increases N, that is, the second, third, etc. occurrences are
;; highlighted and targeted.
;;
;; The sprint-forward/backward commands apply iterative jumping until return/C-G
;; is hit, making it possible to reach any point of the text with just a few
;; keystrokes.
;;
;; To use it, simply put this file under ~/.emacs.d/, add (require 'fastnav) to
;; your emacs initialization file and define some key bindings, for example:
;;
;; (global-set-key "\M-z" 'zap-up-to-char-forward)
;; (global-set-key "\M-Z" 'zap-up-to-char-backward)
;; (global-set-key "\M-s" 'jump-to-char-forward)
;; (global-set-key "\M-S" 'jump-to-char-backward)
;; (global-set-key "\M-r" 'replace-char-forward)
;; (global-set-key "\M-R" 'replace-char-backward)
;; (global-set-key "\M-i" 'insert-at-char-forward)
;; (global-set-key "\M-I" 'insert-at-char-backward)
;; (global-set-key "\M-j" 'execute-at-char-forward)
;; (global-set-key "\M-J" 'execute-at-char-backward)
;; (global-set-key "\M-k" 'delete-char-forward)
;; (global-set-key "\M-K" 'delete-char-backward)
;; (global-set-key "\M-m" 'mark-to-char-forward)
;; (global-set-key "\M-M" 'mark-to-char-backward)
;;
;; (global-set-key "\M-p" 'sprint-forward)
;; (global-set-key "\M-P" 'sprint-backward)
;;
;; Changes:
;;   2010-02-05: Fix for org mode, all commands were broken.
;;               Fix for electric characters in certain modes.
;;   2010-02-11: Yet another minor fix for switching to next/previous char.
;;   2010-05-28: Added sprint commands.
