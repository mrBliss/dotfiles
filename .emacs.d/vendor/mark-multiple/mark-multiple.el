;;; Commentary:

;; An emacs extension that sorta lets you mark several regions at once.
;;
;; More precisely, it allows for one master region, with several mirror
;; regions. The mirrors are updated inline while you type. This allows for some
;; awesome functionality. Or at least, some more visually pleasing insert and
;; replace operations.
;;
;; Done
;; ----
;; * A general library for managing master and mirrors
;; * `mark-more-like-this` which selects next/previous substring in the buffer that
;;   matches the current region.
;; * `inline-string-rectangle` which works like `string-rectangle` but lets you
;;   write inline - making it less error prone.
;; * `rename-sgml-tag` which updates the matching tag while typing.
;;
;; Installation
;; ------------
;;
;;     git submodule add https://github.com/magnars/mark-multiple.el.git site-lisp/mark-multiple
;;
;; Then add the modules you want to your init-file:
;;
;;     (require 'inline-string-rectangle)
;;     (global-set-key (kbd "C-x r t") 'inline-string-rectangle)
;;
;;     (require 'mark-more-like-this)
;;     (global-set-key (kbd "C-<") 'mark-previous-like-this)
;;     (global-set-key (kbd "C->") 'mark-next-like-this)
;;     (global-set-key (kbd "C-M-m") 'mark-more-like-this) ; like the other two, but takes an argument (negative is previous)
;;
;;     (require 'rename-sgml-tag)
;;     (define-key sgml-mode-map (kbd "C-c C-r") 'rename-sgml-tag)
;;
;; Feel free to come up with your own keybindings.
;;
;; Ideas for more
;; --------------
;; * `js-rename-local-var` which renames the variable at point in the local file.
;;
;; Bugs and gotchas
;; ----------------
;; * Adding a master and mirrors does not remove the active region. This might feel
;;   strange, but turns out to be practical.
;;
;; * The current mark-multiple general library lets you do stupid shit, like adding
;;   overlapping mirrors. That's only a problem for people who want to write their
;;   own functions using `mm/create-master` and `mm/add-mirror`.
;;
;; * Seems like there is some conflict with undo-tree.el, which sometimes clobbers
;;   the undo history. I might be doing something particularly stupid. Looking into it.
;;
;; A wild idea
;; -----------
;;
;; Is this a subset of a crazy multiple-point module? How would that even work?
;;
;; There is one use for it I can see, which is editing the end of lines. Set up one
;; cursor at the end of each line, then just edit normally. The command is repeated
;; for each position.
;;
;; Might be too far out there. I still want to do edit-end-of-lines tho.
